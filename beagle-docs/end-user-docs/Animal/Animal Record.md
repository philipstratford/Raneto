# Animal Record Page

## Timeline
The details regarding each different History Item Type displayed in the Animal Timeline are in that History Item's Type own page. For example, for information about how Costs are displayed in the Animal Timeline, see the [Costs](Costs.md) page.

## Referrers Tab
The first table displayed under this tab shows the Animal's primary Referring Practice.
The second table displays a list of all Referring Practices that have ever referred the Animal to the clinic (excluding the current primary Referring Practice). Practices that have previously been the Animal's primary Referring Practice will appear in this list only if they actually referred the Animal to us at least once.

## Images Tab
This area allows you to upload images and videos of the patient to Beagle. All images and videos must be added to a folder, so when you initially select the Images tab you'll see a list of any folders which already exist. To see the images and videos in a folder, just click on the folder's name to open it. To add new images amd videos to the folder, just click on the _Add Files_ button at the top of the tab and then drag and drop files into the grey area which displays the text "Drag images and videos here to upload", or click the _Click here_ button to select images using a file browser. Either way, you can upload multiple files at once.

If you wish to create a new folder for your images, click the _Create New Folder_ button at the top of the Images tab, displayed when the tab is first selected. If you are already inside a folder and wish to return to the list of folders, click on the word _folders_ in the file path displayed at the top of the tab.

### Permitted File Types
The types of file which you can upload to the Animal's record are: .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .tif, .tiff, .avi, and .mp4. If you attempt to upload a file of any other type you will see an error message.

### Editing Image Details
You can edit the details of an image which has been uploaded, such as the display name, the image's description, and whether consent has been obtained for the publication of the image. To do so, hover your mouse's cursor over the name of an image. After a moment, the name will slide up and Edit and Delete buttons will appear. Click on the Edit button (a pencil icon) to open the image's details for editing.

### Deleting an Image
To delete an image, hover your mouse's cursor over the name of an image. After a moment, the name will slide up and Edit and Delete buttons will appear. Click on the Delete button (a dustbin icon) and then confirm the deletion in the pane which pops up.

### Setting the Patient's Avatar
You can set any uploaded image to be the patient's avater - the image which is displayed alongside the Animal's name at the top of the Animal Record page. To do so, edit an image's details, as described above, and check the checkbox labelled _Use this image as the Animal's avatar_.
