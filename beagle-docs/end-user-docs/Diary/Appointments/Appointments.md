# Appointments

## Running Late
An Appointment may be marked as 'Running Late' if the Client contacts the clinic to advise that they're going to be late for the Appointment. Thie can be achieved by clicking the _Running Late_ button in the Appointment Detail Pane in the [Main Diary](Main%20Diary.md). Doing so will launch the Running Late Panel in which an optional note giving more information about the delay can be entered. Clicking the _Mark as Running Late_ button to close the Running Late Panel will update the Appointment and cause a Running Late icon to be displayed alongside the Appointment's sheduled time in the Main Diary's List View and in the [Current Appointments List](Current%20Appointments%20List.md). Hovering your mouse cursor over this icon will display the note entered when the Appointment was marked as Running Late.

To edit the Running Late Note, simply click the Running Late in the Appointment Detail Pane button again.

The Running Late button in the Appointment Detail Pane will be disabled if the Appointment has been Arrived or Cancelled.
