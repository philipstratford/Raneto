# Appointments
Appointments in Tristan are a big deal. In Beagle that isn't the case. In Beagle, Appointments are simply entries in the diary. Appointments are related to [Referrals](Referrals.md), which contain most of the information that is held against Appointments in Tristan (e.g. the reason for the referral, the Referring Vet's details, etc.), and can be of all different types - depending on how Beagle has been configured in your clinic Beagle Appointments could be for patients to be admitted, collected, for Clients to visit their animal and so forth.

Appointments for an Animal can be viewed in either the Main Diary or the Animal's history on the patient record.
