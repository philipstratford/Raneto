# Introduction to Beagle
Beagle is a Hospital Management System (or Hospital Information System) designed and developed in-house by the University of Liverpool. Beagle is a web application, meaning that it is accessed using a web browser such as Google Chrome.

Beagle includes all of the functionality required for the University's veterinary clinics to operate, including an Electronic Patient Record (EPR), pharmacy and stock management, laboratory management, appointment scheduling, client contact management, client account management, clinical research tools, and many other features. A full feature list is available HERE.

The main Beagle product is designed for use in veterinary referral hospitals and first-opinion practices. There is also a separate product called Beagle Pathology which has different functionality and is used in the Veterinary Institute's Clinical Pathology department.
