# Introduction to Searching in Beagle
This article deals with the main Search function in Beagle, which isn't intended for complex queries (e.g. "All dogs presenting with tumours in the past 3 years") which might be useful for research purposes. For these kinds of inquiry Beagle includes a separate [Research](../Research%20Tool.md) tool.

The Search function in Beagle is visible at all times in the top-left corner of every page, next to the Beagle logo. Searching is the entry point to many of Beagle's key functions, which is why it's displayed so prominently. For example, if you want to create a new Client you must first use the Main Search box to search for the Client. Below the search results, one of which might be the Client you were about to create a new record for, is a button for creating a new Client record.

This single Search function can be used for finding Animals, Clients, Referring Practices, Referring Vets and other Beagle Users - there's no need to specify what kind of result you're looking for. Just enter some text and Beagle will return the best results.

The displayed resuls will each include an icon to the left to indicate what kind of result it is. Hovering your mouse cursor over the icon will show the meaning of the icon, and there's a legend in the [main Search article](../search.md). Clicking on a search result will cause it to expand, revealing further information and buttons allowing you to perform common functions relating to that person, practice or animal.

Next to the Main Search box is a link labelled *Advanced...*. Clicking this wil open the [Advanced Search](../Advanced%20Search.md) pane where you can make more specific search enquiries. 

More details about the Main Search function, including which fields are searched for the text you enter, can be found [here](../search.md).
