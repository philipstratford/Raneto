# Introduction to Contact Requests and Contact Records
Contact Requests and Contact Records are exactly what they sound like. 

A Contact Request is a request for someone to make contact with someone else. Typically these will be created by a member of staff in the Reception team when a Client or Referring Vet calls and requests a call back from a vet. The Contact Request will be added and assigned to a vet or Service, with details of whom to call and why. 

Contact Requests are a type of [Action](Actions%20And%20Notifications.md) and are Beagle's equivalent of Tristan's To Dos.

Often closely related to Contact Requests, Contact Records are records of contact that was made with someone else, by whatever means. A Contact Record details who was contacted, the method of contact (e.g. telephone) and relevant details of the communication. A Contact Record might also describe an unsuccessful attempt to make contact, for example if a phone call was made but not answered. When a Contact Request is actioned a corresponding Contact Record would usually be created.

Contact Records are Beagle's equivalent of Tristan's Events.
