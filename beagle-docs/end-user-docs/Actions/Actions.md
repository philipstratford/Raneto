# Actions

## Generation of Actions at Trigger Points

### On Discharge
The actions triggered by discharging an animal are assigned to the service for the Action Type (for example, Scan Case Notes will be assigned to Admin Team). If this is blank, then the Action is generated against the responsible user for the referral. 


## Reassigning Actions
An Action can be assigned to a different User or Service by clicking the Assign Action ![Assign Action](assets/clone.png) button found to the right of the title of the Action. Note that an Action can only be reassigned if it has not been completed, so if you are viewing an Action, e.g. a [Contact Request](Contact%20Request.md), in an Animal's timeline, the Assign Action button will not be displayed if the Action has already been completed.
