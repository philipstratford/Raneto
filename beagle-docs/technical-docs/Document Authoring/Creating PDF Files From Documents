# Creating PDF Files From Documents
When a document authored in Beagle is completed a PDF version of the document is created and stored in the _Attachment_ table to act as a permanent, intransigent record of the document. The creation of the PDF is performed using a library called _[HTML to PDF Converter For .NET](https://www.winnovative-software.com/html-To-Pdf-Converter.aspx)_ from a company named _Winnovative_. The same library is used when a User previews a document that they're authoring, although in that circumstance the PDF isn't stored anywhere in Beagle's database.

## Images
When an image is included in a document authored in Beagle the underlying markup is a simple `<img>` tag. When the HTML of the document is subsequently passed to the _HTML to PDF Converter_ the HTTP call includes all of the cookies relating to Beagle from the calling controller in the Header object. These include Beagle's authentication cookie which allows _HTML to PDF Converter_ to access the images stored within Beagle and render them within the document. Without this, the images are not rendered in the document because the plain HTML rendered for _HTML to PDF Converter_ does not have permission to access the images in Beagle specified by the `src` attributes of the `<img>` tags. The reason for passing all cookies rather than just the authentication cookie is that the authentication cookie has an environment-specific name (e.g. _BeagleEquine_), so the name cannot be determined for inclusion in pre-compilation code.
