# System Configuration
The System Configuration module in the Beagle application allows Users with the appropriate Permissions to configure the instance of Beagle according to their requirements. Most of these configurable elements are values in lookup tables (e.g. Animal Breeds, Appointment Types), but some are settings which affect how the application functions. Most or all of these settings are stored in the database's _SystemConfiguration_ table, which contains a single record with the settings for that Beagle instance.
