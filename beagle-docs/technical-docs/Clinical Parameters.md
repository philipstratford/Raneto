# Clinical Parameters
Clinical Parameters are records of measurements of clinical signs in a patient such as temperature, respiration and weight. 

## Configuration
The Clinical Parameters which may be recorded for a patient are defined as Clinical Parameter Types. These can be configured in [System Configuration](./Features/System%20Configuration.md) on the [Clinical Parameter Types](./Features/Clinical%20Parameter%20Types.md) page. Any Clinical Parameter Type which has the value TRUE in the _IncludeInClinicalObservations_ column will be shown when entering a new Clinical Observation.
